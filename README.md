# E-commerce Version 2

For this project we were tasked to create our previous E-commerce website made with HTML, 
CSS and  JavaScript (front-end based) to React.JS and create a Full-Stack Application.
The website was created using React.JS for the front-end portion and  Node.JS for the back-end portion. 
I decided to use TailwindCSS as a framework to  try something new.




## Requirement for this website were:


- Use Create React App to create a component based application to display your former products page from the first iteration of the project.
- Create a Database that contains your products (name, description, price, etc) and render the products from the database. 
- Create a node server that works with your database.
- Create a filter for the category of the products and for the price. 


Deployment for the Project:
- 
- Front-end:   AWS Amplify 
- Back-end: Heroku with the use of the ClearDB MySQL Add-on. 
## Deployment

```bash
